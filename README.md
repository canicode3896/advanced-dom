# advanced-dom
Advanced DOM is made to provide more functions and better functions for manipulating the HTML5 dom.
## Contributing
If you are contributing please make sure you use parcel or a similar tool to manage development cycles. I will manage all of the builds.
*Do not keep your configuration files in the repository* - they should be gitignored.
**Not everyone uses the same build tool!**
## Getting it
You can find the releases in the release section. Or the latest development build in the /dist directory.
